      [Verse 1: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
      It starts with one
      One thing, I don't know why
      It doesn't even matter how hard you try
      Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
      To explain in due time, all I know
      Time is a valuable thing
      Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
      Watch it count down to the end of the day
      The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal
      Didn't look out below
      Watch the time go right out the window
      Tryin' to hold on, d-didn't even know
      I wasted it all just to watch you go

      [Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
      I kept everything inside
      And even though I tried, it all fell apart
      What it meant to me will eventually be
      A memory of a time when I tried so hard

      [Chorus: Chester Bennington]
      I tried so hard and got so far
      But in the end, it doesn't even matter
      I had to fall to lose it all
      But in the end, it doesn't even matter

      [Verse 2: Mike Shinoda, Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
      One thing, I don't know why
      It doesn't even matter how hard you try
      Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
      To remind myself how I tried so hard
      In spite of the way you were mockin' me
      Actin' like I was part of your property
      Remembering all the times you fought with me
      I'm surprised it got so far
      Things aren't the way they were before
      You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
      Not that you knew me back then
      But it all comes back to me in the end

      [Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
      You kept everything inside
      And even though I tried, it all fell apart
      What it meant to me will eventually be
      A memory of a time when I tried so hard

      [Chorus: Chester Bennington]
      I tried so hard and got so far
      But in the end, it doesn't even matter
      I had to fall to lose it all
      But in the end, it doesn't even matter

      [Bridge: Chester Bennington]
      I've put my trust in you, pushed as far as I can go
      For all this, there's only one thing you should know
      I've put my trust in you, pushed as far as I can go
      For all this, there's only one thing you should know

      [Chorus: Chester Bennington]
      I tried so hard and got so far
      But in the end, it doesn't even matter
      I had to fall to lose it all
      But in the end, it doesn't even matter
